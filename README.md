## Main Features

- **Nutritional Values Calculation**  
  The system calculates total calories, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and more based on the foods entered by the user throughout the day. Data is fetched via API from updated food databases.

- **Personalized Workout Suggestions**  
  Based on the user's profile and personal goals, the calculator offers workouts designed to help achieve optimal results, considering fitness level and nutritional needs.

- **Personalized Meal Suggestions**  
  The system suggests meals according to user preferences, allergies, and lifestyle, and adjusts recommendations based on nutritional gaps identified in the daily diet.

- **Meal Suggestions Based on Daily Intake**  
  After the user logs their meals for the day, the calculator analyzes consumed nutrients and suggests an additional meal to fill nutritional gaps. For example, if the user is short 700 calories and 50 grams of protein, it will recommend a meal aligned with the user's usual eating habits.
